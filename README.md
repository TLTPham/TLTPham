# Hey, I'm Tony!

I'm a software engineer with a passion for building things.
I love learning new things and sharing what I've learned with others.

## I'm currently working on a few personal projects:

- A [tool/wiki](https://ftk2-tools.vercel.app/) for the game: For the King
([Repository](https://github.com/TLTPham/FtK2-Tools))

##
<!-- ## Some functionality of some private projects: -->



## Modules I have made for usage between my projects


I'm also working on a few other projects that I hope to share soon!
